CALIGULA: Make the criminals come in! I must have some criminals! (Continually striking the gong) - I want people to send the condemned to death. Some public, I will have my public! Judges, witnesses, accused; all condemned in advance! Ah! Caesonia, I’ll show them what they’ve never seen — the only free man of this empire!! Written in: 1938-1944
